      This summer-y snacking cake includes a fluffy white cake, marshmallow
      creme, berry jam, and freeze-dried fruit. <br />Here’s the perfect snack
      cake for summer. Egg whites are whisked for a lighter crumb, then flavored
      with a smidge of almond extract for a hint of nuttiness. <br />These
      fluffy snack cakes hold a layer of jam and are coated with a sweet berry
      cream and freeze-dried fruit.

    <h2>Directions:</h2>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and position rack in
        center.
      </li>
      <li>
        Lightly grease bottom of a 9-inch square cake pan. Line bottom with
        parchment paper.
      </li>
      <li>Grease and lightly flour parchment and sides of pan.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, mix butter
        and oil at medium speed until well combined, about 1 minute.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix in sugar at medium-high speed until light and fluffy, 4 to 5
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix in egg whites in 2 or 3 additions at medium speed until well
        combined, scraping bowl well after each addition.
      </li>
      <li>Mix in 1 teaspoon vanilla and the almond extract.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Step 4</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Mix in about 1/3 of flour mixture at low speed.</li>
      <li>Mix in 1/3 cup milk; scrape bowl well.</li>
      <li>
        Repeat, alternating flour mixture and milk, until fully incorporated and
        batter is smooth.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Step 5</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Spread batter in an even layer in prepared pan.</li>
      <li>
        Bake until a toothpick inserted into center comes out clean or with a
        few moist crumbs, about 30 minutes.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Step 6</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Let cool in pan 10 minutes, then run an offset spatula or a knife around
        edge of cake and invert onto a wire rack.
      </li>
      <li>Remove parchment and let cool completely.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Step 7</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Using a large serrated knife, halve cake horizontally to make two
        layers.
      </li>
      <li>Transfer one layer, cut side up, to a platter.</li>
      <li>Top with 1/2 cup jam, spreading evenly.</li>
      <li>Top with second cake layer, cut side down.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Step 8</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, for berry cream, purée remaining 2/3 cup jam in a blender or
        mini food processor until very smooth.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Step 9</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, beat cream
        at medium speed until it begins to thicken, about 1 minute.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix in marshmallow creme at medium-high speed until soft peaks form.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix in puréed jam and remaining 1 teaspoon vanilla at low speed until
        well combined. <br />(If needed, fold whipped cream by hand to more
        evenly incorporate jam.)
      </li>
      <li>Frost top and sides of cake with berry cream.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Step 10</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        For garnish, crush freeze-dried berries with a mortar and pestle (or
        your hands) into a mixture of small pieces and powder; sprinkle over
        cake.
      </li>
      <li>Cut cake into 12 pieces.</li>
      <li>
        Chill in an airtight container until ready to serve, up to 2 days.
      </li>
    </ul>
