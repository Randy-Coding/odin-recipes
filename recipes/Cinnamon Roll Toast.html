    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      It's cinnamon roll pull apart toast. <br />Picture layers of fluffy French
      bread coated in a decadent cinnamon-sugar blend and topped with a luscious
      cream cheese glaze. <br />It’s part cinnamon roll, part French toast, and
      100% delicious. Whether you make it for breakfast, brunch, or an afternoon
      snack, this is the easiest baked masterpiece to ever come out of your
      oven.<br />
      “It’s SO fun-looking,” said recipe taster Elizabeth Mervosh. “And I could
      honestly eat the whole thing.”

    <ol>
      <li>
        <h4>Gather all ingredients:</h4>
        Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8.5- x 4.5-inch
        loaf pan with cooking spray <br />and line with parchment paper,
        allowing 2 inches to hang over the long sides. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Prepare the Bread:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Stir together brown sugar, cinnamon, and salt in a small bowl until
            fully combined. Set aside.
          </li>
          <li>Place a sheet of parchment paper on a work surface.</li>
          <li>
            Unfurl 1 of the cans of dough and gently stretch and/or roll into a
            10- x 12-inch rectangle.
          </li>
          <li>
            Brush 2 tablespoons of the butter evenly over the entire dough.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sprinkle half (about heaping 1/3 cup) of the cinnamon-sugar mixture
            to the edges of the dough to cover completely; lightly press and
            smooth out to adhere (there will be some that falls off).
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

          <li>
            Stack dough rectangles on top of each other. Carefully transfer
            stack to prepared pan with rectangles standing upright (like
            dominoes).
          </li>
          <li>
            Repeat with remaining can of dough, butter, and cinnamon-sugar
            mixture.

            golden, 40 to 45 minutes, tenting with foil after 30 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>Remove from oven and let cool in the pan for 5 minutes.</li>
          <li>
            Use parchment as handles to carefully lift loaf out of pan and onto

          <li>
            Beat cream cheese in a medium bowl with an electric hand mixer until
            whipped.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add powdered sugar, 3 tablespoons of the milk, vanilla, and salt;
            beat until smooth and creamy, adding more milk, <br />1 1/2
            teaspoons at a time, until desired consistency is reached.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
